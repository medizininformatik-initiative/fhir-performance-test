# fhir-performance-test

This repository allows a German DIC to test the performance of its own FHIR Server implementation.

It references other repositories, which allows one to not only test any FHIR Server, but also allows a DIC to test existing
example FHIR Servers on their hardware and/or generate specific testdata to resemble a common load on the FHIR Server.
